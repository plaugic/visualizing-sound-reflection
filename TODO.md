    - [ ] Allow `FIBONACCI_SCORE_CAP_INDEX` to be set via UI slider
  - [ ] **Advanced Scoring Models:**
    - [ ] Introduce scoring penalties (e.g., for very long ray paths, excessive bounces beyond a soft cap)
    - [ ] Experiment with alternative scoring functions (e.g., exponential decay, custom curves for bounces)
    - [ ] Weight scores by angle of incidence on listener (optional)

### B. Sound Propagation Physics üîä
  - [ ] **Material Interactions:**
    - [ ] Define acoustic properties for materials (absorption, reflection coefficients).

  - [ ] **Adversarial / Competitive Modes:**
    - [ ] One object (e.g., source) tries to maximize score, while the other (e.g., listener) tries to minimize its own score or a related metric.
  - [ ] **Population-Based Methods:**
    - [ ] Explore Genetic Algorithms or Evolutionary Strategies for optimizing object positions and potentially other parameters (e.g., `numRays`, `maxReflections`).
  - [ ] **Reinforcement Learning (RL) - Experimental:**
    - [ ] Define a clear state space, action space, and reward function for object placement.
    - [ ] Experiment with simple RL agents (e.g., Q-learning, Deep Q-Network if feasible) for guiding one or both objects.
  - [ ] **Surrogate Modeling / Bayesian Optimization:**
    - [ ] If full ray evaluations are very costly, investigate building a surrogate model of the score landscape to guide search more efficiently.

## VI. Performance Optimizations üöÄ
### A. Go / WebAssembly Core
  - [ ] **Algorithmic Optimizations for Raycasting:**
    - [ ] Further optimize `performRaycast` with more aggressive early exits and optimized mathematical operations.
    - [ ] If spatial partitioning (Octree/Grid from III.C) is implemented, use it to accelerate ray-object intersection queries significantly.
  - [ ] **Concurrency & Parallelism (Advanced - requires careful JS interop):**
    - [ ] Explore if batches of rays (e.g., within `visualizeSoundPropagation` or `calculateListenerScore`) can be processed concurrently using Go goroutines before results are aggregated for JS.
    - [ ] **(Major)** Investigate moving the entire Go WASM simulation and learning loop to a Web Worker to prevent blocking the main browser thread, carefully managing data synchronization.
  - [ ] **Memory Management:**
    - [ ] Profile Go WASM execution for memory allocations in performance-critical loops (raycasting, learning steps).
    - [ ] Minimize allocations by reusing objects/slices where possible (e.g., sync.Pool for temporary ray data).
### B. JavaScript & Three.js Rendering
  - [ ] **Draw Call Reduction:**
    - [ ] Use `THREE.InstancedMesh` for rendering large numbers of identical static objects (if applicable to scene design).
    - [ ] For complex static parts of the scene, consider merging geometries to reduce draw calls.
  - [ ] **Level of Detail (LOD):**
    - [ ] If complex imported meshes are supported, implement LODs to render simpler versions for distant objects.
  - [ ] **Throttling & Debouncing:**
    - [ ] Ensure `renderSceneJS` is not called excessively or unnecessarily from Go, especially during rapid iterations in learning mode. Implement more aggressive throttling for UI updates during learning.
  - [ ] **Data Transfer Go <-> JS:**
    - [ ] Analyze and optimize the format and method of transferring scene and ray data. Explore direct use of `ArrayBuffer`s passed via `js.TypedArrayOf` if performance profiling indicates this as a bottleneck.
### C. Overall System Responsiveness
  - [ ] **Progressive Detailing / Adaptive Performance:**
    - [ ] During fast interactions (e.g., dragging objects, rapid learning iterations), automatically reduce `numRays` or visualization complexity (e.g., fewer bounces shown).
    - [ ] Restore full detail when the system is paused or interaction stops.
  - [ ] **Caching:**
    - [ ] Cache results of expensive calculations if inputs haven't changed significantly (e.g., part of the score for a static configuration).
